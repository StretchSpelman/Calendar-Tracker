# Calendar-Tracker

## Description
- For this project I was tasked to add onto existing javascript code to create a website that is a calendar tracker for a 9-5 hour period, while having different colors appear for if it is in the past present or future.
- My motivation for this project was so I can better understand javascript as well as the addons since this was a real hair puller for me and I had to do some extra research on it.
- The reason I built and edited this assignment was because I am very bad at managing and keeping track of time and things I need to so this would definitely help me out.
- During this project I learned how to problem solve on my own by using resources such as google and AI tools to give me a better understanding of things I just cant seem to grasp such as some terminology used inside of java script and, and comparing code with other code I already had to see why something did or did not work, as well as using the developer tools inside of google chrome to troubleshoot and inspect things further.
